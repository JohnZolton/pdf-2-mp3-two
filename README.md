# pdf-2-mp3-two
## convert any pdf to an audio .wav file!

installation
clone this repository

```git clone https://github.com/JohnZolton/pdf-2-mp3-two.git```

install requirements

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

to run:

```streamlit run audiobooker.py```

Uses streamlit for a gui, just drag and drop your pdf to convert. It takes a while so i tried using a text file to save progress but it feels clunky, any suggestions welcome. Output will be "output.wav" in the project directory.
